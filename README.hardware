4. BSP Notes
============

4.1 TI AM335xEVM
================

The AM335x General Purpose EVM is a standalone test, development, and
evaluation module system that enables developers to write software and
develop hardware around an AM335x processor subsystem.

For a full description of the AM335x EVM, please refer to the following link:

4.1.1 Validated Board Info
--------------------------

This BSP is only validated in following environment. If you use this BSP
in a different environment it may possibly have some issues.

	Processor:		AM335X-GP rev 1.0
	Board Rev:		TI-AM335X EVM, CPU board REV 1.2A
	BootLoader:		U-Boot
	BootLoader Version:	U-Boot 2023.04-gd74d0993e2 (Oct 18 2023 - 17:49:46 +0000)

4.2 BeagleBoneBlack(BBB)
========================

The BeagleBone Black is a lower-cost, high-expansion focused BeagleBoard using a
low cost Sitara AM3358BZCZ100 Cortex A8 ARM processor from Texas Instruments.

For a full description of BBB, please refer to the following link:
  http://beagleboard.org/getting-started

4.2.1 Validated Board Info
--------------------------

	Processor:		AM335X-GP rev 2.1
	Board Rev:		RevC
	BootLoader:		U-Boot
	BootLoader Version:	U-Boot 2023.04-gd74d0993e2 (Oct 18 2023 - 17:49:46 +0000)

4.3 Hardware profile settings for AM335X-EVM
============================================

This EVM has many different subsystems to allow development around the AM335x's
capabilities. Most of the subsystems are fixed with regard to address locations
and pin assignments. However, there are some functions that can be changed by
configuring the EVM with switches, which some of the AM335x pins are connected
to different subsystems based on this CPLD profile. And the CPLD profile number
is selected by a 4bit DIP switch(sw8) on the GP daughterboard.

Currently, only profile #0 and #1 are validated.
